How to Run the Application
Create a virtual environment (recommended):

bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the application:

bash
python app.py
Access the application at http://localhost:5000

Worldwide Deployment Using Your Desktop as Storage
To deploy your Willow Clint platform worldwide while using your desktop as storage, we'll need a solution that:

Makes your local server accessible worldwide

Maintains your existing local storage setup

Is completely free

Best Solution: Cloudflare Tunnel (Free Tier)
Why Cloudflare Tunnel?

Makes your localhost accessible worldwide

Uses your existing desktop storage

Free tier is generous (no bandwidth limits)

Includes free SSL certificate

Provides DDoS protection

Step-by-Step Implementation
1. Install Required Software
First, install these on your desktop:

bash
# Install Cloudflare CLI (on your desktop)
npm install -g cloudflared
2. Create Cloudflare Account
Go to Cloudflare and sign up

Add a domain (you can get a free one from Freenom or use a subdomain from Cloudflare)

3. Set Up Cloudflare Tunnel
Run these commands in your terminal:

bash
# Authenticate with Cloudflare
cloudflared tunnel login

# Create a new tunnel
cloudflared tunnel create willow-clint

# This will generate a tunnel ID - note it down
4. Configure the Tunnel
Create a configuration file config.yml in your project directory:

yaml
tunnel: YOUR_TUNNEL_ID
credentials-file: /path/to/credentials.json

ingress:
  - hostname: willow-clint.yourdomain.com
    service: http://localhost:5000
  - service: http_status:404
5. Run Both Your App and Tunnel
First terminal (run your Flask app):

bash
python app.py
Second terminal (run the tunnel):

bash
cloudflared tunnel --config config.yml run willow-clint
6. Set Up DNS
In your Cloudflare dashboard:

Go to DNS settings

Create a CNAME record pointing to your tunnel:

Type: CNAME
Name: willow-clint
Target: YOUR_TUNNEL_ID.cfargotunnel.com
Proxy status: Proxied (orange cloud)
7. Keep It Running Constantly
To ensure 24/7 availability:

Use tmux or screen to keep sessions running

Or create system services (more advanced)

For Windows:

powershell
# Create a scheduled task to run at startup
$action = New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute "python" -Argument "app.py"
$trigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -AtStartup
Register-ScheduledTask -TaskName "WillowClintApp" -Action $action -Trigger $trigger
Alternative Solution: Ngrok (Simpler but Limited)
If Cloudflare seems complex, you can use Ngrok's free tier:

bash
# Install ngrok (https://ngrok.com/download)
ngrok http 5000
Limitations:

Free tier has random URLs that change each time

Limited concurrent connections

Bandwidth restrictions

Important Security Considerations
Add Authentication:
Modify your app.py to add basic auth for the upload page:

python
from flask_httpauth import HTTPBasicAuth

auth = HTTPBasicAuth()

users = {
    "admin": "your-strong-password"
}

@auth.verify_password
def verify_password(username, password):
    if username in users and users[username] == password:
        return username

@app.route('/upload')
@auth.login_required
def upload():
    # existing code
Firewall Configuration:

Ensure your desktop firewall allows incoming connections on port 5000

On Windows: Allow Python through Windows Defender Firewall

On Mac/Linux: Configure appropriate ufw or iptables rules

Monitor Resource Usage:

Your desktop will need to stay powered on

Consider bandwidth limitations of your home internet connection

Maintenance Tips
Auto-restart on crashes:
Use a process manager like PM2 (even for Python apps):

bash
npm install -g pm2
pm2 start "python app.py" --name willow-clint
pm2 save
pm2 startup
Logs Monitoring:
Check logs regularly with:

bash
pm2 logs willow-clint
# or
journalctl -u your-service-name -f
Would you like me to provide more specific instructions for any particular step or explain how to set up automatic thumbnail generation with this deployment method?
